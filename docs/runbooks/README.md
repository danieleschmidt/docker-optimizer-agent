# Operations Runbooks

## Overview

This directory contains operational runbooks for the Docker Optimizer Agent. These runbooks provide step-by-step procedures for common operational scenarios, troubleshooting, and incident response.

## Runbook Categories

### ðŸš¨ Incident Response
- [**High CPU Usage**](incident-response.md#high-cpu-usage) - When optimization processes consume excessive CPU
- [**Memory Leaks**](incident-response.md#memory-leaks) - Memory consumption grows over time
- [**Security Scanner Failures**](incident-response.md#security-scanner-failures) - Trivy or other security tools fail
- [**Service Unavailable**](incident-response.md#service-unavailable) - Application becomes unresponsive

### ðŸ”§ Maintenance Procedures
- [**Dependency Updates**](maintenance.md#dependency-updates) - Updating Python packages and base images
- [**Security Patch Management**](maintenance.md#security-patches) - Applying security updates
- [**Database Cleanup**](maintenance.md#database-cleanup) - Cleaning logs and temporary data
- [**Certificate Renewal**](maintenance.md#certificate-renewal) - TLS certificate management

### ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Alerting
- [**Alert Triage**](monitoring.md#alert-triage) - Responding to monitoring alerts
- [**Performance Degradation**](monitoring.md#performance-degradation) - Handling performance issues
- [**Capacity Planning**](monitoring.md#capacity-planning) - Resource usage analysis
- [**Metric Validation**](monitoring.md#metric-validation) - Ensuring metrics accuracy

### ðŸ”„ Deployment Operations
- [**Rolling Updates**](deployment.md#rolling-updates) - Safe deployment procedures
- [**Rollback Procedures**](deployment.md#rollback) - Emergency rollback steps
- [**Configuration Changes**](deployment.md#configuration-changes) - Updating application configuration
- [**Scaling Operations**](deployment.md#scaling) - Horizontal and vertical scaling

## Runbook Structure

Each runbook follows this standard structure:

### 1. Overview
- Brief description of the scenario
- When to use this runbook
- Expected time to resolution

### 2. Detection
- Symptoms and indicators
- Monitoring alerts
- User reports

### 3. Initial Response
- Immediate actions to take
- Safety checks
- Communication procedures

### 4. Investigation
- Diagnostic steps
- Data collection
- Root cause analysis

### 5. Resolution
- Step-by-step fix procedures
- Verification steps
- Documentation requirements

### 6. Prevention
- Long-term solutions
- Process improvements
- Monitoring enhancements

## Usage Guidelines

### Before Using Runbooks
1. **Assess the situation** - Understand severity and impact
2. **Follow escalation paths** - Contact appropriate teams
3. **Document actions** - Keep detailed logs of all steps taken
4. **Communicate status** - Update stakeholders regularly

### During Execution
1. **Follow procedures exactly** - Don't skip steps unless critical
2. **Verify each step** - Confirm actions before proceeding
3. **Take snapshots** - Capture system state before major changes
4. **Time box activities** - Set reasonable time limits for investigation

### After Resolution
1. **Document outcomes** - Record what worked and what didn't
2. **Update runbooks** - Improve procedures based on experience
3. **Conduct post-mortem** - Learn from incidents
4. **Share knowledge** - Brief team on lessons learned

## Runbook Maintenance

### Regular Reviews
- **Monthly**: Review alert thresholds and procedures
- **Quarterly**: Update contact information and resources
- **After incidents**: Update runbooks based on lessons learned
- **During changes**: Update procedures when systems change

### Version Control
- All runbooks are version controlled in Git
- Changes require peer review
- Major updates need team approval
- Historical versions are preserved for reference

## Training and Preparation

### Team Readiness
- **New team members** must review all runbooks
- **Regular drills** to practice procedures
- **Cross-training** to ensure coverage
- **Knowledge sharing** sessions quarterly

### Tool Familiarity
- Monitoring dashboard navigation
- Log query and analysis
- Command-line troubleshooting
- Emergency communication channels
