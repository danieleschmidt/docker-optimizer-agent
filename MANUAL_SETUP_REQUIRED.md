# Manual Setup Required - GitHub Workflow Security

## 🚨 Important Notice

Due to GitHub's security restrictions, **GitHub Actions workflows cannot be created programmatically**. The autonomous SDLC enhancement has prepared all necessary workflow configurations, but the actual `.github/workflows/*.yml` files need to be manually created to enable the complete CI/CD pipeline.

## 📁 Workflow Files to Create Manually

The following workflow files have been designed and are ready to be created in `.github/workflows/`:

1. **ci.yml** - Core CI/CD pipeline with multi-Python matrix testing
2. **security.yml** - Comprehensive security scanning (CodeQL, Trivy)  
3. **release.yml** - Automated PyPI and Docker Hub publishing
4. **performance.yml** - Performance benchmarking and regression detection
5. **docs.yml** - Documentation automation and validation
6. **dependency-update.yml** - Automated dependency maintenance

## 📋 Manual Steps Required

### 1. Copy Workflow Files (CRITICAL)

The following workflow files have been created locally but need manual GitHub upload:

```bash
# These files exist locally and need to be manually committed:
.github/workflows/ci.yml                    # Core CI/CD pipeline
.github/workflows/security.yml              # Security scanning  
.github/workflows/release.yml               # Automated releases
.github/workflows/performance.yml           # Performance testing
.github/workflows/docs.yml                  # Documentation automation
.github/workflows/dependency-update.yml     # Dependency maintenance
```

### 2. Repository Configuration

#### Branch Protection Rules
Navigate to `Settings > Branches > main` and configure:
- ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
- ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ✅ Include administrators

#### Required Status Checks
Add these checks once workflows are active:
- `test (3.9)`, `test (3.10)`, `test (3.11)`, `test (3.12)`
- `security / codeql`
- `security / trivy`
- `benchmark`

### 3. Repository Secrets

Add these secrets in `Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions`:

```
CODECOV_TOKEN=<codecov_upload_token>
DOCKER_USERNAME=<docker_hub_username>
DOCKER_PASSWORD=<docker_hub_token>
PYPI_API_TOKEN=<pypi_trusted_publisher_token>
```

### 4. GitHub Features to Enable

#### Security Tab
- ✅ Enable CodeQL security scanning
- ✅ Configure Dependabot alerts
- ✅ Enable secret scanning

#### Pages (for Benchmarks)
- ✅ Enable GitHub Pages
- ✅ Set source to GitHub Actions
- ✅ Configure for benchmark reporting

## 🎯 Quick Setup Checklist

- [ ] **Step 1**: Manually commit `.github/workflows/` files to repository
- [ ] **Step 2**: Configure branch protection rules on main branch
- [ ] **Step 3**: Add required repository secrets (4 secrets)
- [ ] **Step 4**: Enable security features (CodeQL, Dependabot)
- [ ] **Step 5**: Enable GitHub Pages for benchmark reports
- [ ] **Step 6**: Test first workflow by creating a pull request

## 🚀 Validation Steps

Once manual setup is complete:

1. **Create Test PR**: Make a small change and create PR to `main`
2. **Verify Workflows**: Check that all 6 workflows execute successfully
3. **Test Security**: Verify CodeQL and Trivy scans complete
4. **Check Coverage**: Confirm Codecov integration works
5. **Performance**: Validate benchmark reporting

## 📊 Expected Workflow Execution

After manual setup, every PR will trigger:
- ✅ **CI Pipeline**: Tests across Python 3.9-3.12
- ✅ **Security Scanning**: CodeQL + Trivy + dependency review
- ✅ **Performance Testing**: Automated benchmarks
- ✅ **Documentation**: Automated building and validation
- ✅ **Quality Gates**: Coverage, security, performance thresholds

## 🔗 Documentation References

- **Complete Implementation**: See `docs/SDLC_ENHANCEMENT_SUMMARY.md`
- **Workflow Details**: Review individual `.github/workflows/*.yml` files
- **Monitoring Setup**: Use `make monitor` for observability stack
- **GitHub Actions**: [Official Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

## ⚠️ Why Manual Setup is Required

GitHub's security model prevents programmatic creation of workflows to prevent supply chain attacks. This is a **security feature**, not a limitation. The autonomous system has prepared everything - manual activation ensures security compliance.
