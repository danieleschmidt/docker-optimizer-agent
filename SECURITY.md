# Security Policy - Quantum Task Planner

## 🔒 Security Architecture

### Core Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions
3. **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
4. **Secure by Default**: Secure configurations out of the box
5. **Fail Securely**: System fails to a secure state

### Security Features

- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all user inputs
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling without information disclosure
- **Logging**: Security events are logged for monitoring
- **Configuration Security**: Secure default configurations
- **Dependency Management**: Regular security updates

## 🛡️ Security Controls

### Input Validation

All task and resource data is validated using Pydantic models with strict type checking and value constraints.

### Error Handling

Comprehensive exception handling prevents information leakage and ensures graceful degradation.

### Dependency Security

- Pinned dependency versions in requirements.txt
- Regular vulnerability scanning
- Automated security updates

## 🚨 Security Scanning

Run security checks:

```bash
python3 security_scan.py
```
