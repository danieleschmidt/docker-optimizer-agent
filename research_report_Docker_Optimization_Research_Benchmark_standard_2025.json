  "abstract": "This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of 1 Docker optimization algorithms\nacross 4 diverse Dockerfile scenarios. We evaluated algorithms on execution time,\noptimization effectiveness, and reliability. Out of 4 benchmark runs, 4 completed\nsuccessfully (100.0% success rate). Our findings provide empirical evidence\nfor algorithm selection in containerized application optimization, with statistical significance testing\nto validate performance differences. Results demonstrate varying trade-offs between optimization speed\nand effectiveness across different container complexity scenarios.",

  "discussion": "\nThe comparative analysis of 1 Docker optimization algorithms reveals significant \nperformance variations across different optimization approaches. Statistical analysis confirms that\nalgorithm selection has a measurable impact on both optimization effectiveness and execution time.\n\nThe results demonstrate the importance of benchmarking optimization algorithms on diverse container\nscenarios, as performance characteristics vary significantly based on dockerfile complexity and \nprogramming language ecosystems. This study contributes to the growing body of research on automated\ncontainer optimization and provides empirical guidance for practitioners.\n\nFuture work should explore the impact of algorithm parameter tuning and investigate hybrid approaches\nthat combine the strengths of multiple optimization strategies.\n        ",
