## Manual Setup Required

### CI/CD Pipeline Templates (Session 5)
Due to GitHub workflows permission constraints, the following CI/CD templates were designed but require manual setup:

1. **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** - Multi-matrix testing (Python 3.9-3.12), linting, security scans
2. **`.github/workflows/security.yml`** - CodeQL, Semgrep, Bandit, dependency review
3. **`.github/workflows/release.yml`** - Automated PyPI publishing with artifact signing

These templates provide comprehensive CI/CD with quality gates, security scanning, and automated releases.
