# Security Compliance Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the security compliance framework for the Docker Optimizer Agent, including security controls, vulnerability management, and compliance standards.

## Security Framework

### 1. Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

- **Pre-commit Security Scanning**: Bandit, safety, and detect-secrets
- **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning**: Safety and Dependabot integration
- **Code Review Requirements**: All changes require maintainer review
- **Security Testing**: Automated security tests in CI/CD pipeline

### 2. Vulnerability Management

#### Vulnerability Reporting
- **Internal Issues**: Use GitHub security vulnerability template
- **Sensitive Issues**: Report to security@terragonlabs.com
- **Response SLA**: 24 hours for critical, 72 hours for high severity

#### Vulnerability Assessment Process
1. **Detection**: Automated scanning and responsible disclosure
2. **Triage**: Severity assessment using CVSS v3.1
3. **Response**: Fix development and testing
4. **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure timeline

### 3. Security Controls

#### Input Validation
- Dockerfile content sanitization
- Command injection prevention
- Path traversal protection
- Size limits for uploaded content

#### Authentication & Authorization
- API key management for external services
- Principle of least privilege
- Secure credential storage practices

#### Data Protection
- No sensitive data in logs
- Secure temporary file handling
- Memory cleanup after processing

## Compliance Standards

### Docker Security Best Practices
- Non-root user enforcement
- Minimal base image recommendations
- Layer optimization for attack surface reduction
- Security label enforcement

### Supply Chain Security
- Dependency pinning and verification
- Base image vulnerability scanning
- SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation capability
- Signed container image support

### Privacy and Data Handling
- No persistent data storage of user Dockerfiles
- Temporary processing with automatic cleanup
- No telemetry data collection without consent

## Security Testing

### Automated Security Tests
```bash
# Security scanning
bandit -r src/
safety check
semgrep --config=auto src/

# Dependency scanning
pip-audit
trivy fs .

# Container scanning
trivy image docker-optimizer:latest
```

### Manual Security Testing
- Penetration testing for CLI interface
- Dockerfile parsing security validation
- External service integration security review

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Classification
- **P0 Critical**: Remote code execution, data breach
- **P1 High**: Local privilege escalation, sensitive data exposure
- **P2 Medium**: Denial of service, information disclosure
- **P3 Low**: Minor security improvements

### Response Timeline
- **Critical (P0)**: Immediate response, 4-hour fix target
- **High (P1)**: 24-hour response, 7-day fix target
- **Medium (P2)**: 72-hour response, 30-day fix target
- **Low (P3)**: Next release cycle

## Security Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- Mean Time to Detection (MTTD)
- Mean Time to Response (MTTR)
- Vulnerability fix rate
- Security test coverage
- False positive rate

### Reporting
- Monthly security metrics dashboard
- Quarterly security review meetings
- Annual security audit

## External Security Tools Integration

### Required Tools
- **Trivy**: Container and filesystem vulnerability scanning
- **Bandit**: Python security linting
- **Safety**: Python dependency vulnerability checking
- **Semgrep**: Static analysis security scanning

### Optional Enhancements
- **Snyk**: Advanced vulnerability management
- **OWASP ZAP**: Dynamic application security testing
- **SonarQube**: Code quality and security analysis

## Compliance Certifications

### Current Status
- SOC 2 Type II: In progress
- ISO 27001: Planned for 2026
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework: Implemented

### Evidence Documentation
- Security control implementation evidence
- Risk assessment documentation
- Incident response records
- Security training completion records
