# Docker Optimizer Agent - Project Charter

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: Docker Optimizer Agent  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Charter Date**: 2025-08-02  
**Project Owner**: Terragon Labs  

## Problem Statement

Developers struggle with creating optimal, secure Docker images due to:
- Complex best practices and security requirements
- Manual optimization processes that are time-consuming
- Lack of automated analysis for multi-stage builds and layer optimization
- Security vulnerabilities in container images going undetected
- Performance bottlenecks from suboptimal image configurations

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- **Dockerfile Analysis**: Automated parsing and optimization recommendations
- **Security Scanning**: Integration with external security tools (Trivy)
- **Performance Optimization**: Layer analysis, multi-stage build suggestions
- **Language-Specific Optimizations**: Tailored recommendations for Python, Node.js, Go, Java
- **CLI Interface**: User-friendly command-line tool with comprehensive options
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Health checks, metrics, and performance tracking

### Out of Scope
- **Runtime Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes deployment configurations
- **Image Registry Management**: Registry-specific operations beyond basic integration
- **Container Runtime Security**: Runtime monitoring and threat detection
- **Custom Base Image Creation**: Building custom base images from scratch

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
- **Security**: 90%+ reduction in critical vulnerabilities detected
- **Performance**: 30%+ average reduction in image size
- **Usability**: Sub-5 second analysis time for typical Dockerfiles
- **Adoption**: Comprehensive documentation and examples for all supported languages

### Secondary Success Metrics
- **Code Quality**: 85%+ test coverage with comprehensive CI/CD pipeline
- **Community**: Clear contribution guidelines and responsive issue management
- **Reliability**: 99.5% uptime for CLI operations with proper error handling

## Stakeholders

### Primary Stakeholders
- **Development Teams**: Primary users requiring Docker optimization
- **DevOps Engineers**: Integration into CI/CD pipelines
- **Security Teams**: Vulnerability assessment and compliance requirements

### Secondary Stakeholders
- **Platform Teams**: Infrastructure optimization and standardization
- **Open Source Community**: Contributors and users of the public tool
- **Compliance Teams**: Security policy and audit requirements

## Key Deliverables

1. **Core Optimizer Engine**: Dockerfile parsing and optimization logic
2. **Security Integration**: Trivy scanner integration with vulnerability reporting
3. **CLI Interface**: Comprehensive command-line tool with multiple output formats
4. **Documentation Suite**: User guides, API documentation, and best practices
5. **Testing Infrastructure**: Unit, integration, and benchmark test suites
6. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing, security scanning, and release processes

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Security Scanner Dependencies**: External tool availability and API changes
- **Docker Ecosystem Changes**: Rapid evolution of Docker features and best practices

### Medium Risk
- **Performance Scalability**: Large Dockerfile analysis performance
- **Multi-Language Support**: Maintaining optimization quality across languages

### Low Risk
- **CLI Interface Changes**: Well-established patterns and stable APIs
- **Documentation Maintenance**: Automated generation and validation processes

## Resource Requirements

### Technical Resources
- **Python Development Environment**: 3.9+ with comprehensive tooling
- **Container Runtime**: Docker or compatible container engine
- **Security Tools**: Trivy scanner for vulnerability assessment
- **CI/CD Infrastructure**: GitHub Actions for automated workflows

### Documentation Resources
- **Technical Writing**: Comprehensive user and developer documentation
- **Example Repository**: Sample Dockerfiles and optimization demonstrations
- **Community Management**: Issue triage and contribution review processes
