# Performance Guidelines

## Performance Standards

This project maintains strict performance benchmarks to ensure optimal user experience.

## Benchmarking Infrastructure

### Automated Testing
- **Benchmark Suite**: `benchmarks/run_benchmarks.py`
- **CI Integration**: Performance regression detection
- **Reporting**: GitHub Pages deployment of results

### Key Metrics
- **Dockerfile Optimization**: Sub-second analysis
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB peak during processing
- **Throughput**: >50 Dockerfiles/minute batch processing
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >80% for repeated optimizations

## Performance Optimization Techniques

### 1. LRU Caching
```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=128)
def optimize_dockerfile(content: str) -> OptimizationResult:
    # Cached optimization logic
```

### 2. Parallel Processing
- Multi-threaded batch processing
- Async I/O for external integrations
- Process pools for CPU-intensive tasks

### 3. Memory Management
- Streaming for large files
- Garbage collection optimization
- Memory profiling in tests

## Monitoring

### Metrics Collection
- **OpenTelemetry**: Distributed tracing
- **Prometheus**: Performance metrics
- **Grafana**: Real-time dashboards

### Alert Thresholds
- Response time >1s: Warning
- Memory usage >200MB: Critical
- Cache hit rate <70%: Warning

## Optimization Checklist

- [ ] Profile new features with `pytest-benchmark`
- [ ] Validate memory usage with `memory-profiler`
- [ ] Test under load with concurrent processing
- [ ] Monitor metrics in development environment
- [ ] Document performance characteristics
